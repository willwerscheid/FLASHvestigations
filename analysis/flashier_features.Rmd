* Handles sparse matrices (of class `Matrix`), tensors (3-dimensional arrays), and low-rank matrix representations (as returned by, for example, `svd`, `irlba`, `rsvd`, and `softImpute`). 
* Implements a full range of variance structures, including “kronecker” and “noisy.” In general, the estimated residual variance can be an arbitrary rank-one matrix or tensor.
* For simple variance structures (including “constant” and “by row”/“by column”), no $n \times p$ matrix is ever formed (so, for example, a matrix of residuals is never explicitly formed). This yields a large improvement in memory usage and runtime for very large data matrices. (Benchmarking results are [here](flashier_bench.html).)
* Speeds up backfits by using an "extrapolation" technique similar to the method described in [Ang and Gillis](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/neco_a_01157) (2019).
* Simplifies the user interface. Everything is done via a single function with a small number of parameters, and the latter are more user-friendly. In particular, a new `prior.family` parameter replaces the less friendly `ebnm.fn` and `ebnm.param`.
* In constrast, the “workhorse” function gives many more options. One that I especially like allows the user to write an arbitrary function whose output will be displayed during optimization (allowing the user to inspect the progress of optimization however they like).
* Uses a home-grown initialization function rather than `softImpute`. The new function is much faster than `softImpute` for large matrices (see the [benchmarking results](flashier_bench.html)).
* Instead of sampling the full $LF'$ matrix, the sampler now just samples $L$ and $F$ separately. This reduces memory usage by a factor of $\min(n, p)$. (With large data matrices, the `flashr` sampler is basically useless because every sample takes up as much memory as the data matrix itself.)
