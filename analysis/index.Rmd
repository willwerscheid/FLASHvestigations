## In Progress

[Investigation 5a.](init_fn.html) We should change the default `init_fn` to `udv_si_svd` when there is missing data and `udv_svd` otherwise.

[Investigation 5b.](init_fn2.html) More evidence supporting a change to the default initialization function. 

[Investigation 8.](parallel.html) Parallelizing backfitting updates shows some promise.


## Still Relevant

[Note 1.](obj_notes.html) Notes on computing the FLASH objective function. I derive an explicit expression for the KL divergence between prior and posterior. 

[Note 2.](flash_em.html) An alternate algorithm for optimizing the FLASH objective, using the explicit expression derived in the previous note.

[Investigation 4.](alt_alg.html) The alternate algorithm agrees with FLASH with respect to both the objective and fit obtained.


## Archived

The bug causing the problem described in Investigations 1-3 was fixed in version 0.1-13 of package `ebnm`.

[Investigation 1.](objective.html) The FLASH objective function can behave very erratically.

[Investigation 2.](objective2.html) This problem only occurs when using `ebnm_pn`, not `ebnm_ash`.

[Investigation 3.](objective3.html) The objective can continue to get worse as loadings are repeatedly updated. Nonetheless, convergence takes place (from above!).

Investigations 6 and 7 are concerned with warmstarts, which were implemented in version 0.5-14 of `flashr`.

[Investigation 6.](warmstart.html) Poor `optim` results can produce large decreases in the objective function. We should use warmstarts when `ebnm_fn = ebnm_pn`.

[Investigation 7.](warmstart2.html) The advantages of warmstarts are not nearly as compelling when `ebnm_fn = ebnm_ash`.
