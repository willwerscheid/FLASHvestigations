[Investigation 1.](objective.html) The FLASH objective function appears to behave erratically.

[Investigation 2.](objective2.html) This problem only occurs when using `ebnm_pn`, not `ebnm_ash`.

[Investigation 3.](objective3.html) The objective can continue to get worse as the loadings are repeatedly updated. Nonetheless, convergence (from above) takes place.
