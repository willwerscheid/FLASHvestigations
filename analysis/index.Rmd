## Current

[Note 1.](obj_notes.html) Notes on computing the FLASH objective function. I derive an explicit expression for the KL divergence between prior and posterior. 

[Note 2.](flash_em.html) An alternate algorithm for optimizing the FLASH objective, using the explicit expression derived in the previous note.

[Investigation 4.](alt_alg.html) The alternate algorithm agrees with FLASH with respect to both the objective and fit obtained.


## Archived

The bug causing the problem described in Investigations 1-3 was fixed in version 0.1-13 of package `ebnm`.

[Investigation 1.](objective.html) The FLASH objective function can behave very erratically.

[Investigation 2.](objective2.html) This problem only occurs when using `ebnm_pn`, not `ebnm_ash`.

[Investigation 3.](objective3.html) The objective can continue to get worse as loadings are repeatedly updated. Nonetheless, convergence takes place (from above!).
